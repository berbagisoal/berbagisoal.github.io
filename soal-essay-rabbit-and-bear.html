In contrary, the bear was always clumsy and could not use the arrow to good advantage. One day, the bear called over the rabbit and asked the rabbit to take his bow and arrows to hunt. He shot enough buffalo to satisfy the hungry family. There was lots of meat left after the bear and his family had loaded themselves and packed all they could carry home. The bear was very gluttonous and did not want the rabbit to get any of the meat. The poor rabbit would have to go home hungry after his hard day's work. The bear was the father of five children. The youngest child was very kind to the rabbit. The mother bear always gave him an extra large piece of meat but the youngest child did not eat it. He would take it outside with him and pretended to play ball with the meat. The meat would fly into the rabbit's house.

                                            Once upon time there lived as neighbors a bear and a rabbit. The rabbit was a good shot and the bear, being very clumsy, could not use the arrow to good advantage the bear was very unkind to the rabbit. Every morning, the bear would call over to the rabbit and asked the rabbit t take his bow and arrow and came with the bear to the other side of the hill. The rabbit, fearing to arouse the bear’s anger by  refusing consented to go with the bear and shot enough buffalo to satisfy the hungry family. Indeed he shot and killed  so many that there was lots of meat left after the bear and his family had loaded themselves and packed all they could carry home. How ever, the poor rabbit could not even taste the blood from the butch ring, as the gluttonous bear would throw earth  on the blood and dry it up. Poor rabbit  would have to go home hungry after his hard day’s work.               The bear was the father of five children. The youngest bear was very kind to the rabbit. The mother bear, knowing that her youngest child was a very hearty easter, always gave him an extra large piece of meat. The baby bear did not eat this extra, large piece of meat. Instead, he would take the meat outside and would pretend to play ball with it, kicking it towards the rabbit’s house, and when he got close to the door he would give the meat such a great kick that it would fly into the rabbit’s house. In this way, the poor rabbit would get his meal unknown to the papa bear. What did we learn from the story?A. Being honest is not always wise                       B. To love means to shareC.

Once upon a time, there lived a bear and a rabbit. The rabbit was a good shot. On the contrary, the bear was always clumsy and could not use the arrow to shoot
.
One day, the bear called over the rabbit and asked the rabbit to take his bow and arrows. Because he was afraid to arouse the bear's anger,  he did not refuse the challenge. He went with the bear and shot buffaloes. He shot and killed so many that there were lots of meats left after.
However the bear did not make the rabbit get any of the meat. Even he could not taste it. The poor rabbit went home hungrily after a day of hard work.
Fortunately, the youngest child of the bear was very kind to the rabbit. His mother bear always gave him an extra large piece of meat but he did not eat it all. He took some outside with him and pretended to play ball with the meat. He kicked the ball of meat toward the rabbit's house. The meat flew into the rabbit's house. In this way, the hungry rabbit got his meal</a>

Once upon a time, there lived as neighbors, a bear and a rabbit. The rabbit was a good shooter and the bear 
being very clumsy could not use the arrow to good advantage.
One day, the bear called over the rabbit and asked the rabbit to take his bow and arrows and came with bear 
to the other side of the hill. The rabbit, fearing to arouse the bear’s anger, consented and went with the bear and 
shot enough buffalo to satisfy the hungry family. Indeed he shot and killed so many that there was lots of meat left 
after the bear and his family had loaded themselves and packed all they could carry home.
However, the bear was so greedy and evil that he did not allow the rabbit to get any of the meat. The rabbit 
could not even taste the blood from the butchering, as the bear would throw earth on the blood and dry it up. The 
poor rabbit would have to go home hungry after his hard day’s work.
The bear was the father of five children. The youngest child was very kind to the rabbit. He was very hearty 
eater. The mother bear always gave him an extra-large piece of meat but the youngest child did not eat it all. He 
would take it outside with him and pretended to play ball with the meat. He kicked it toward the rabbit’s house and 
when he got close to the door he would give the meat with such a great kick. The meat would fly into the rabbit’s 
house. In this way, the poor rabbit would get his meal unknown to the papa bear.

The bear was the father of five children. The youngest boy was very kind to the rabbit.  Knowing that the youngest boy was a very hearty eater, the mother bear always gave him an extra- large piece of meat.  Instead of eating this extra meat, the youngest bear would take the meat outside and pretend to  play ball with it, kicking it toward the rabbit’s house, and when he got close to the door he would give the meat such a great kick that it would fly into the rabbit house. In this way the poor rabbit  would get his meal unknown to the papa bear.

However the bear was so greedy and evil that he didn’t allow the rabbit to get any of the meat.

Who was a good shot and who wasn't?<br />The rabbit was a good shot but the bear wasn't.<br /><br />3. Why couldn't the rabbit refuse the bear's offer/order to go hunting with him?<br />Because the rabbit was too scared, he was afraid that the bear might get very angry, (filled with enough rage to threaten/eat the rabbit instead).<br /><br />4. Did the rabbit get some meat? Why? So what happened to the rabbit then?<br />No, he didn't. Because the bear was just too greedy to share some of the meat with the rabbit. Well, the rabbit went home..alone and hungry.<br /><br />5. Who helped the rabbit so he could finally get some meat?<br />The bear's youngest child did. He spared some of his meat for the rabbit. He kicked it up into the rabbit's house. And that's it. That's how the rabbit finally got some meat.<br /><br />-semoga membantu-<br />

                            34. the bear, being very clumsy, could not use an arrow to a good advantage. The bear was very unkind  to the rabbit, every morning, the bear would call cover to the rabbit and ask the rabbit to take his  bow and arrows and come with the bear to other of the hill. The rabbit fearing to arouse the bear’s anger by refusing, consented, and went with the bear to  the other side of the hill. The rabbit, fearing they arouse the bear’s anger by refusing, consented  and went with the bear. The rabbit shot enough buffalo to satisfy the bear’s family. Indeed, he shot  and killed so many that there was still lots of meat left after the bear and his family had loaded  themselves and packed all they could carry home. However the bear was so greedy and evil that he didn’t allow the rabbit to get any of the meat.  The poor rabbit could not even taste the blood from the butchering, as the bear would throw Erath  on the blood and dry it up. The poor rabbit would have to go home hungry after his hard day’s  work. The bear was the father of five children. The youngest boy was very kind to the rabbit.  Knowing that the youngest boy was a very hearty eater, the mother bear always gave him an extra- large piece of meat.  Instead of eating this extra meat, the youngest bear would take the meat outside and pretend to  play ball with it, kicking it toward the rabbit’s house, and when he got close to the door he would give the meat such a great kick that it would fly into the rabbit house. In this way the poor rabbit  would get his meal unknown to the papa bear.

Rabbit, takut mereka memprovokasi kemarahan beruang dengan menolak, setuju dan pergi dengan beruang. Kelinci ini menembak cukup banyak kerbau untuk memuaskan keluarga beruang.

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>berikut ini adalah cerita naratif tentang legenda Malin Kundang dalam bahasa Inggris:</p><p></p><p>Long time ago, in a coastal village of West Sumatra, Indonesia, lived a young and strong boy named Malin Kundang. He came from a poor family, but he was determined to make a better life for himself and his mother. He would go out to sea every day to catch fish, hoping to bring back enough to sell and support his family.</p><p></p><p>One day, while he was fishing far out at sea, a storm suddenly appeared. The waves grew enormous, and his small boat was tossed around like a leaf. Despite his best efforts, he couldn't control the boat, and it crashed against the rocks. Malin Kundang was thrown onto the shore, battered and bruised.</p><p></p><p>As he lay on the beach, a group of villagers found him. Among them was a woman who looked familiar – his own mother. She had been searching for him since the storm had hit. But instead of showing concern for her son's well-being, Malin Kundang denied knowing her. He was now wealthy and successful, and he was ashamed of his poor mother.</p><p></p><p>The heartbroken mother cried and begged her son to recognize her. She pleaded with him to return to his senses and show some compassion. But Malin Kundang was unyielding. He turned his back on his mother and walked away, leaving her weeping on the shore.</p><p></p><p>As Malin Kundang continued on his path of wealth and prosperity, he grew even richer. He became a successful trader with a grand mansion and a lavish lifestyle. But his success was accompanied by arrogance and cruelty. He became known for his heartlessness and lack of compassion.</p><p></p><p>Years later, when Malin Kundang was sailing near the same village, his ship was caught in a tempest. The waves roared, and the ship was on the brink of destruction. In his desperation, Malin Kundang finally remembered his mother and how he had abandoned her.</p><p></p><p>As he cried out for help, the storm's fury reached its peak. A thunderbolt struck his ship, and it crumbled into pieces. Malin Kundang was transformed into a stone, forever to be stranded on the shores of his homeland as a punishment for his heartlessness and betrayal.</p><p></p><p>And so, the legend of Malin Kundang serves as a reminder that wealth and success mean nothing if they are gained at the cost of compassion and respect for others. The story has been passed down through generations, a cautionary tale of the consequences of arrogance and the importance of remaining true to one's values.</p><br />

                        The Fish and the Salamander At the beginning of time, Fish and Salamander looked very much alike. They were discussing how they planned to evolve. "I wish to grow thinner, with a broad tail," said Fish. "Then, I will swim like lightning and outrace any pond creature. How about you?" Salamander considered, "Well, it would certainly be nice to be the fastest creature in the pond. However, I think will keep my awkward tail, which allows me to swim well enough. What I wish to change instead is to grow modest legs" Fish laughed. "Legs? In a pond? What a waste!" Soon, though, came a drought and the pond began to dry up. Fish was trapped, but Salamander was able to crawl out, to find another pond. "How did you know that legs would come in so handy?" cried Fish to its departing friend. "I didn't," said Salamander, "But I wasn't so naive as to assume that circumstances today would be the same as that of tomorrow." The story tells us that versatility is a lead to Success.<br />

One day, the king went sailing accompanied by his loyal bodyguards. Along the way, the hurricane came. The guards begged the king to cancel his plan. “Sir, it is dangerous if we continue the journey with this condition. It’s better if we stop first to a safer place. If I am not mistaken, there is a place nearby here named Tumasik Island. “What if we stay there while waiting for a safer condition?” Said the captain of the ship. The king approved this opinion. Their boat was docked to Tumasik Island shortly afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Arriving on the island, King and several bodyguards left the ship and looked around the island. When they’re looking around, suddenly an animal which was not far from them flashed. The king was surprised and fascinated. The beast was so huge, looked dashing, and was golden in color.” What creature was that?” Asked the King to his guards. “If i am not mistaken, people call it “Singa”, your majesty,” one of his bodyguards replied. “What?” Asked the King to clarify. “Singa” replied the guard.</p><p></p><p>The king then asked more explanation about the animal. Attentively, The King listened to all explanations from his bodyguard about the animal. “Then, we give the name of this place “Singapore”.”Meaning: The City of Lion which is derived from malay “Singa” (lion) and “Pura / Pore” (City)”. Since that time the town was named Singapore.</p><p></p><p>Terjemahan</p><p></p><p>Asal Nama Singapura</p><p></p><p>Ratusan tahun yang lalu hiduplah seorang raja bernama Nila Utama, Raja Sriwijaya. Pada suatu hari, Raja pergi berlayar ditemani pengawal-pengawal setianya. Di tengah perjalanan, angin topan datang. Para pengawal memohon agar raja membatalkan niatnya. “Tuan, sungguh berbahaya jika kita meneruskan perjalanan dengan kondisi seperti ini. Lebih baik jika kita singgah dulu ke tempat yang lebih aman. Kalau hamba tak keliru, ada tempat terdekat dari sini yang bernama Pulau Tumasik. Bagaimana jika singgah di sana sembari menunggu kondisi yang lebih aman?” kata kapten kapal. Raja menyetujui pendapat tersebut. Perahu mereka pun merapat ke Pulau Tumasik tak lama setelah itu.</p><p>Sesampainya di pulau tersebut, Raja dan beberapa pengawalnya meninggalkan kapal dan berkeliling melihat-lihat pulau tersebut. Saat mereka sedang melihat-lihat sekeliling, tiba-tiba seekor binatang berkelebat tak jauh dari tempat mereka. Raja terkejut dan terpukau. Binatang itu sanagat besar, tampak gagah, dan berwarna keemasan. “Mahluk apakah itu?” tanya sang Raja kepada para pengawalnya. “Kalau hamba tak salah, orang-orang menyebutnya singa, Yang Mulia,” jawab salah seorang pengawalnya. “Apa?” tanya sang Raja memperjelas. “Singa” jawab pengawal tadi.</p><p>Raja lalu meminta penjelasan lebih banyak tentang biantang tersebut. Dengan penuh perhatian, Raja mendengarkan semua penjelasan pengawalnya tentang binatang itu. “Kalau begitu, kita beri nama tempat ini Singapura. Artinya: Kota Singa yang diperoh dari bahasa melayu “Singa” dan “Pura”. Sejak saat itulah kota itu bernama Singapura.</p><br />

Inside the cave, Aladdin was surprised by what he saw. Every corner was full of gold and treasures. A few minutes later, he found the lamp and quickly returned to the entrance of the cave. Aladdin called out, “Magician, I have found the lamp.” “Excellent,” answered the magician. “Quick, pass it to me!”<br /><br />Aladdin did not trust the magician so he said, “Not so fast Magician. You must help me out of this cave first.”<br /><br />The magician became very angry. When Aladdin was walking to the entrance, the magician pushed a huge rock over the entrance of the cave and left Aladdin and the lamp behind. Aladdin tried to move the rock all by himself, but it was too big and heavy, “Oh no! I am trapped in the cave!” he cried.<br /><br />Suddenly, he remembered the magic ring. He rubbed it with the palm of his hand. To his surprise, a genie appeared before him and in a powerful voice said, “Master, I am the Genie of the ring. How can I help you?”<br /><br />Aladdin was frightened, but he soon found the courage to ask, “Could you please send me back to my house?” In no time at all Aladdin was back home.<br /><br />Aladdin took out the lamp.

                        <p> </p><p>Legend of Bledug kuwu</p><p></p><p>In a long time ago, around 7th BC, Grobogan was included in Medang Kamulan Kingdom ruled by Sanjaya Dynasty. One of the kings of this dynasty was Dewata Cengkar, a reputedly very fond of eating human flesh. Because the king’s favorite was strange, the people felt fear. They did not want to be one of the king’s preys. Nothing could beat the king with his power.</p><p></p><p>One day, there were Ajisaka, a nomad, who were concerned with the suffering experienced by the people. Then, Ajisaka was trying to stop the practice of the king. Witnessed by thousands of pairs of eyes, Ajisaka also challenged the king to compete their magic power. Many people doubted the ability of Ajisaka, considering his small body. But several communities still put their hopes to Ajisaka. The king accepted the challenge of Ajisaka only with laughter. The King also offered, if ever Ajisaka was able to defeat him, then Ajisaka was entitled to a prize of half the kingdom. Conversely, the King would take Ajisaka’s body.</p><p></p><p>Ajisaka accepted the King’s offer. One last demand of Ajisaka, if he was defeated and his body is eaten by the King, was to bury his bones in the ground which was as wide as his headgear. The King absolutely agreed it and didn’t infer at all whether Ajisaka’s headgear was a sacred headgear. Ajisaka took his headgear off soon and put it on the ground. Suddenly, the headgear became very wide so that King Dewata Cengkar must stepped backward. Because of the width of Ajisaka’s headgear, King Dewata Cengkar was thrown in the South Sea. The King, however, did not die and turned into "bajul" (white crocodile). Afterwards, the people crowned Ajisaka as the King of Medang Kamulan.</p><p></p><p>When Ajisaka ruled Medang Kamulan, there was a dragon whose name was Jaka Linglung. According to his confession, he was Ajisaka’s son and he was searching for his father. Regarding his shape, Ajisaka refused to confess him as his son. Ajisaka tried to expel the dragon euphemistically. Ajisaka promised the dragon that he would confess him as his son if he could kill the white crocodile who was Dewata Cengkar in the South Sea. Because of it, Jaka Linglung afforded Ajisaka’s demand to kill Dewata Cengkar. Jaka Linglung left Medang Kamulan. Ajisaka forbade Jaka Linglung through the land so that he didn’t bother the people’s tranquillity. Conversely, Ajisaka required Jaka Linglung to go to the South Sea through the underground.</p><p></p><p>In brief, Jaka Linglung arrived in the South Sea and killed Dewata Cengkar. As the way he departed, he went back to Medang Kamulan through the underground. As the proof that he had arrived in the South Sea and killed Dewata Cengkar, Jaka Linglung brought a bundle of grinting wulung grass and the salty sea water.</p><p></p><p>Jaka Linglung tried to appear to the surface several times because of the suspect that he had been in his destinations. The first time he appeared was in the Village Ngembak (now the City Purwodadi District), in Jono (Tawangharjo District), in Grabagan, Crewek, and the last was in Kuwu (third entry Kradenan District). In Kuwu, Jaka Linglung was releasing his tiredness. The tracks of his emergence created some mud explosions. And this is, where the emergence was appeared, now believed to be the original legend of Bledhug Kuwu.</p><p> </p><p></p><br />

Last week I took my five-year old son, Willy, to a musical
instrument store in my hometown. I wanted to buy him a set of junior drum
because his drum teacher advised me to buy him one. Willy likes listening to
music very much. He also likes asking me everything he wants to know. Even his
questions sometimes seem precocious for a boy of his age. He is very
inquisitive.

<br />

We went there by car. On the way, we saw a policeman
standing near a traffic light regulating the passing cars and other vehicles.
He blew his whistle now and then.

<br />

Seeing the policeman blowing his whistle, Willy asked me at

Hearing his unexpected question I answered reluctantly,
